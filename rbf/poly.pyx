def mvmonos(x, degree, diff=None):
    '''
    Multivariate monomial basis functions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : (..., D) float array
        Positions where the monomials will be evaluated.

    degree : int or (M, D) int array
        If this is an int, it is the degree of polynomials spanned by the
        monomials. If this is an array, it is the power for each variable in
        each monomial.

    diff : (D,) int array, optional
        Derivative order for each variable.

    Returns
    -------
    (..., M) array
        Alternant matrix where each monomial is evaluated at `x`.

    Example
    -------

    >>> pos = np.array([[1.0], [2.0], [3.0]])
    >>> pows = np.array([[0], [1], [2]])
    >>> mvmonos(pos, pows)

    >>> pows = np.array([[0, 0], [1, 0], [0, 1]])

def monomial_powers(degree, ndim):

    Returns an array containing the powers for the monomial basis functions

    Example
    -------
